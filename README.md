<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Landing Page with React and TypeScript

Welcome to the _GitHub repository_ of TRACTIAN's **Landing Page**!
Here you can find information about the project's development, such as which technologies were used, how to install and run the project, usage and more.

This application was developed as a **Front-end challenge** for [**Tractian**][tractian-url].
The goal was to recreate their existing homepage using pure **React**, meaning, only the essencial libraries, in the span of 10 days.

I was able to create a fully responsive header and hamburger menu, as well as eight different sections:
- Home, or "Hero";
- Teaser (slider and panel);
- Products;
- Why Tractian;
- How It Works (panel);
- Testimonials (slider);
- Schedule a demo (form);

I also had total freedom in regards to the UI, and could take inspiration from [**Cobli**][cobli-url]'s website.
With the exception of the original images, all the other icons and illustrations were created by me using [**Figma**][figma-url] and [**designstripe**][designstripe-url].

    alt="Animated Game GIF"
    height="380px"
    width="380px"
  />

</div> -->

<br />

During the development I was able to:

* Develop a React.js app using **TypeScript**;
* Declare the Component props and state types using interfaces;
* Use the `useRef` and `useState` React Hooks to store and manipulate data;
* Use the `useEffect` React Hook to control the component's lifecycle;
* Import fonts from Google Fonts;
* Use CSS variables and media queries to apply responsive design;
* Understand how a SVG is different from a regular image file (say, a png);
